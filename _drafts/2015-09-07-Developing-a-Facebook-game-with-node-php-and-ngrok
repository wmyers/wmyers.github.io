The Facebook canvas game tutorial provides an example HTML5 game called *Friend Smash* that you can add social features to. The game has a php entrypoint *index.php* and FB recommends using XAMPP to develop the game locally.

**tl:dr**

This post details how to use a local Node Express server and a ngrok tunnel to develop a social FB game locally and preview within the Facebook Canvas Frame chrome.
