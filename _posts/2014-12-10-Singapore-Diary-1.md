Dear Singapore Diary,

I've been in Singapore for about a year and a quarter. The end of 2014 is nearly upon us and it is traditionally a time to look back with anger/joy/indifference.

Anyhoo seems like a good time to start this Singapore journal that I've been mentally narrating to myself for a while now. It might have some therapeutic benefits.

So a brief recap
