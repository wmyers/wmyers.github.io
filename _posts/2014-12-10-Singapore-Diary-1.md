Dear Sing Diary, I've now been in Singapore for about a year and a quarter. The end of 2014 is nearly upon us and it is traditionally a time to look back in anger/joy/indifference.

It also seems a good time to start this Singapore journal that I've been mentally narrating to myself for a while. It might have some therapeutic benefits...

So a brief recap on where I am and how I got here.
