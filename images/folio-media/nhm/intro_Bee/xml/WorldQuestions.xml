		<Answers>
			<a1>Compare recent bumblebee distribution data with surveys taken in the 1960s and 1970s and it becomes clear that some UK species are declining</a1>
			<a2>We think two species have been lost, and others are threatened – scientists are investigating the status of the species like the ones on display</a2>
			<a3>A major reason is that flowers like red clover, on which the bees feed, are disappearing because of changes in the way farm land is used</a3>
			<a4>Bumblebees are important natural pollinators of many food plants, so this poses a problem for farmers</a4>
